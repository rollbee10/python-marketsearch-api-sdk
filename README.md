# MarketSearch API SDK

[Marketcheck API](https://pages.linkhere.com/) provides access to New, Used and Certified cars inventory for all car dealers in USA and Canada.

The API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to access most Marketcheck resources. We are continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!

We blog about the API on [Medium](https://medium.com/marketcheck-apis/) Please follow us on Medium :-)
